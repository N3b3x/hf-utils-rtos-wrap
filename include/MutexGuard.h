 * The MutexGuard class provides an RAII-style mechanism for owning a
 * mutex for the duration of a scoped block. When a MutexGuard object
 * is created, it attempts to take ownership of the mutex. When the
 * object is destroyed, it releases the ownership of the mutex.
 *
 * Example:
 * \code{.cpp}
 * {
 *     MutexGuard lock(&myMutex);
 *     // critical section
 * }
 * // mutex is released here
 * \endcode
 *
